//! This file olds the principals init function to setup the x86_64 envirorment

/// Initializes the x86_64 environment for the Horizon Kernel.
///
/// This function performs low-level hardware setup using inline assembly.
/// Specifically, it interacts with I/O port addresses to configure the serial port (UART)
/// settings, such as setting the baud rate divisor and clearing line control registers
/// for early kernel logging and debugging.
///
/// # Safety
/// This function is marked `unsafe` because it executes raw inline assembly
/// (`core::arch::asm!`), directly reading and writing to hardware I/O ports
///  (`0x3F8`, `0x3F9`, `0x3FB`).
/// Improper port manipulation can cause undefined behavior or hardware instability.
